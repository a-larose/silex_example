### Setup ###

Install web server (be sure mod_rewrite and php openssl extension are activated)

Launch composer install (or php composer.phar install)
Config your sql connection (in config/config.php)
Launch cours.sql

On a basic local server everything should be fine on localhost/public/

This was made as an example for a little silex introduction.
